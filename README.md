# ClearLEth

A leave management system that leverages blockchain technology.

## Problem Statement
Current leave management systems are outdated and there are a few problems that stem from adopting it. Firstly, many employees are struggling to clear their days of annual leave, because of the covid-19 pandemic and travel restrictions. Companies will also suffer low-productivity if everyone were to take leave at the same time. Likewise, employers may abuse their power/authority and cancel planned leaves for employees in the event where the company requires the extra manpower during certain key events. 

## Solution
ClearLEth is a decentralized application available for anyone on the web to use, providing core features to aid leave management in a workplace.

By interacting with our smart contracts, employees can submit their leave applications easily, while employers can then approve of these applications without the information going through 3rd party services. Key information being written on the blockchain will allow for transparent tracking for both employees, employers and the public.
